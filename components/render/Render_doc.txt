Response from AI -> 
Split into array ["some text", "<some-tag>value</some-tag>", "some text"]

- The text is pass through MD to HTML conversion
- The tag is extract into 1.Type of tag, 2. The content inside

Type of tag is used in Render.vue to render correct component (v-ifs) and the content is pass
through as props. 

#Rearrangement -> The fund card component will be sorted to the end so multiple fund cards,
will be displayed ALL on top of each other at the end of the "chat bubble"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have set 5 colors each for each fund type SSF, RMF, TESG -> within PortStore.ts
and will loop through these color array to add colors to the portfolio pie chart.
